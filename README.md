# Parental oversight on Spotify
CS410 Text Information Systems Project 

## Team members: 
* Sam Parmar 
* Vijay Mishra 
* Pragya Mishra

## Background:
* Spotify is an audio streaming platform created by the Spotify Technology S.A. company originally
out of Sweden
* Individuals can listen via free memberships or premium memberships. Premium memberships can
be individual, family or student.
* As Spotify has gained popularity, more and more children are using the platform to listen to music.
* As of November 2019, Spotify does not currently have parental control for family accounts.
   * The feature is being developed by the folks at Spotify for parents to control many family accounts. 
   * There is an explicit content filter, however accounts must individually have the explicit content filter enabled or disabled.

## Function of tool:
The project focuses on parental oversight with Spotify. Parents with access and control over their son or daughterâ€™s Spotify accounts will be equipped with a simple tool to analyze trends in listening history and understand emotional content of the listening choices (listened to songs) of their children. 

## Use cases: 
* By allowing parents to track listening history and explore listening trends over time, parents can be alerted  abnormal listening choices or sudden change in listening choices that may indicate a shift in the child's mood. Such a mood change in the child may be due to external circumstances such as bullying or association with bad company. 
* Additionally, non-parents can also utilize the tool to assess their own music choices which may also coordinate with personal mood. 

## Software implementation documentation:
1. Angular UI - front end code (all under angular-app)
directory - angular-app  
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200 --disable-host-check

1. App Server (4201) - Backend Server which does all the heavy lifting. this is one which calls spotify, genius and sentiment analysis.
python3 app-server.py  
   1. User song data pull with Spotify api
   1. Lyrics data pull Genius api pull (using song info obtained form Spotify api)
   1. Sentiment analysis (using lyrics data obtained from Genius api)
 
1. Login server (4202) (borrowed Obscurify) this implements the oauth flow for Spotify - we are using implicit authorization.
directory - angular-app
node login_server.js <client id> <secret>
   1. Note: The OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant type is utilized for authentication w/ short lived access tokens.

## Software usage documentation:
1. Visit the following link in your web browser: 
1. Login with Spotify account
   1. Authorize access to proceed
1. Wait for tool to process song data
1. Review music choices and see trends
   1. Emotional content of music choices is plotted in trend graph via sentiment analysis

## Contribution of each team member:
* All team members collectively came up with the idea for the project
* Sam Parmar was the team leader for the project. Sam led work with the Spotify and Genius APIs to pull/parse song and lyrics data. He  assisted Pragya and Vijay in the web programming, and he outlined the presentation and maintained documentation. 
* Vijay Mishra developed the sentiment analysis model to assess emotions conveyed in text. Vijay also led the  web programming for the project by developing the app server and login server on AWS. Vijay developed the UI, persistent caching, and website security certificates to avoid browser privacy error. 
* Pragya Mishra assisted in the web programming defining the JSON format data and ensured the sub-programs effectively linked together.
